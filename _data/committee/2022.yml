    comment: "After having to travel from outside of Oxford (St Hugh’s) to get to training, we are confident Hannah has the dedication to take up the helm of OUBaC president. Despite having suffered a dislocated shoulder, a concussion and a member of OUBaC running her over, Hannah has not been deterred from playing badminton - it is no accident she has got to where she is. A third year chemistry student, Hannah always knows to produce a solution to any problems she may encounter. Aided by an excellent relationship with her VP, Hannah will lead OUBaC to an even better season than the last!"

    comment: "Science fans will be excited to hear of the discovery of a new universal constant; the OUBaC mixed captain. As he embarks on his 4th year in the role, Ian will also turn his hand to a broader role within the club - that of Vice President. His experiences as club coach, key M1 player and head barbecue chef provide equal contributions to his eligibility for the job, as he helps Hannah steer the club to success."

    comment: "Whether he is chaperoning his teams to BUCs matches or helping fellow OUBaC members navigate the slippery floors of Park End, Robert has quickly become an integral member of OUBaC. As Rob reaches the end of his 2nd (read: gap) year studying PPE, I am sure that OUBaC’s accounts are in safe hands - fingers-crossed he gets access before he leaves. Rob has notably upheld a longstanding M1 tradition after a wing mirror was on the receiving end of a small “practice lap” incident. A testament to his investment in OUBaC’s rich history and proud legacy. Rob has already left a visible legacy of his own, his most avid and devoted supporters already reminisce over his almost-egg victory on his M1 Varsity singles debut (“if only he hadn’t lost those 16 points”). Whilst Rob dispelled the stereotype surrounding Slovak drinking prowess on his first attempted OUBaC night out, which involved a few intimate hours alone with a holy shrine, I have every confidence that only a “small” part of the entz budget will be devoted to Borovička. Na zdravie!"

    comment: "Freya will be adding Secretary to her roster of committee positions for O.U.B.a.C over the years. She has become adept at balancing work for a Classics degree with hours dedicated to the badminton club - finding players for W2, as President or Welfare Rep, and participating in matches and training. All this previous experience will put Freya in an excellent position to take receiving many emails from Sports Fed and making a list of all the hundreds of club members in her stride. The club will be in a sound position with Freya as Secretary as long as the college rowing club doesn’t poach her!"

    comment: "James received exactly zero votes in his bid to be this season's M1 captain. However, due to a technicality - the requirement for M1 captain to have two working ACLs - James is back and ready to do it all over again... even if the men's squad aren't."

    name: Mar Umbert Kimura
    email: maria.umbertkimura@some.ox.ac.uk
    comment: "Mar is one of the biggest BNOCs you’ll ever meet; the sheer number of people she knows should guarantee that she can always get enough players for W1 matches (even if it involves stealing people from the Somerville music society). However, more famous than Mar and her musical talent is her alter ego- ‘singles Mar’. Although she claimed to be solely a doubles player, several times this year Mar has been forced to reawaken her inner singles player and to our surprise she is unbeatable on the singles court- despite the fact she stands at a mere 2 rackets tall. No doubt Mar will take this winning mentality (and many memes) into her season as W1 captain."

    email: atithya.maheshwari@st-hildas.ox.ac.uk
    comment: "Despite questionable commitment in his 1st year due to alleged 'big tendencies' for a night out, Ati (2nd year physics and philsophy) has heroically pledged unwavering commitment in his role as M2 captain for the upcoming year. A highlight of his drunken antics includes trying to chat up a French Badminton Player at the European Univeristy Games by shadowing his favourite shot she plays and slurring the words 'the way you arch your back on the around the head is so cool'. With this in mind, we are confident Ati's game both on and off the court will remain exemplary for M2 as he leads them to victory in the forthcoming year."

    comment: "Eliza is one of the most committed and enthusiastic players at OUBaC, making daily appearances at training sessions and clubnight (and also nights at clubs ofc). Her doubles partnerships are unbeatable, and her motivation is infectious - making any team with Eliza a force to be reckoned with. She is sure to lead W2 to great successes at the Oxford Local League and Varsity matches this year!"

    name: David Guo
    email: zonghao.guo@stx.ox.ac.uk
    comment: "Drive, commitment, teamwork? David has it all. If you’re not seeing David on the court he’s probably at the side calling your name or shouting in support. The badminton veteran has seen it all, having played local matches and university league match ups. Aside from being a supportive teammate and friend on the court, David has some serious technique, especially with his drive doubles defence. It’s fair to say that M3 is in safe hands with David at the helm."

Despite her hectic schedule as a finalist, Ashley has finally joined the roster of clubnight reps and we are excited to have her bring her contagious energy to all OUBac sessions."

Having spent a year mastering the intricacies of Playwaze, Rash returns to hold the whole establishment together. His enthusiasm and experience will certainly help boost clubnight to greater heights, as he continues to organise evenly balanced courts and makes sure everyone has a great time!"

    comment: "Frequenting the Parkend cheese floor far more than his 9am lectures, we can only applaud James for his commitment to preparing for the role of being this year’s entz rep rather than a future doctor. His strengths include minesweeping cheap wine and teaching teamwork skills to those who had to collectively carry his semi conscious body along the parkend queue. His weaknesses include dancing and misdiagnosing his own broken wrist. 

With a strong attendance at OUBaC entz since she was a fresher, Sophie will be sure to carry her weight when it comes to spearheading OUBAaC quizzes, scavenger hunts and games nights. Her strengths include being mind numbingly good at Pictionary and eating breadsticks. Her weaknesses include being scared of her own nose and still not knowing how to play ‘this is a witch’ 3 years in. 

Being entz rep in his 2nd year before OUBaC presidency, Lucien is sure to bring a range of experience to the table. Whether it’s busting a move on the Bridge RnB floor or playing in the annual squash fixture, Lucien will be there with enthusiasm. His strengths include being tall enough to spot in large crowds and being able to host OUBaC events at his college (Peters). His weaknesses include being a bad vegan and getting kicked out Parkend for sleeping."

    comment: "It was an easy rise to power for this year's welfare reps, after they coordinated a sham election to get themselves on the committee. While the integrity of the vote may be in question, the support this team will provide is not. Samvida, Siam and Freya are an approachable bunch that will work hard to signpost welfare resources offered by Sportsfed and the wider university to OUBaC members. They are a port of call for members with any welfare question which can be discussed in complete confidence."

    comment: "Matthew, a third year DPhil Student in the BioDTP, comes ably prepared to take on the strenuous role of IT rep. Coming right off a busy season where he played important roles in M1 and M2's BUCS success, Matthew will aim to build on this upcoming season by ensuring our website remains intact and our insta content is frequent. Let's hope he can extend the use of his magical left (and maybe right) hand off court, as he proves his GitHub game is as underrated as his singles."
