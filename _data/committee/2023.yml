    comment: "Yes he may be studying for a DPhil in SABS R^3 CDT. Yes he may have experience training in the M1 squad of one of the best sports unis in the country. Yes he may have a passed his minibus test and can now transport OUBaC across the globe. But Nathan holds a far more important qualification for President…. he has a spy on the inside. Hopefully, gaining information on CUBaC through his brother will allow him to lead us to yet another Varsity stomping. We all anticipate with bated breath for the rematch of Schofield v. Schofield."

    comment: "Mar is extending her time at Oxford for two reasons: to officially become a master musician, and more importantly to expand on her growing OUBaC committee experience. Indisputably relevant credentials for the VP role include: a successful W1 captaincy, official BNOC status, and a runner up medal in the coveted OUBaC biggest wingspan award. Mar will undoubtedly draw on of this experience to guide her through her vice presidency. <br /><br />
    Also, Mar is two rackets tall."

This man is about to take OUBaC by storm as our incoming Vice-President, after successfully transporting his team to every away match as M2 captain. When he's not acing BUCS matches (#ScottIsCarrying), he's hard at work ensuring that the m2ilf insta page is taken to new levels of dank memery. We look forward to him unlocking new levels to his meme game after being bossed around by a couple of pint-sized individuals (we won't throw any shade by mentioning names) this year. If you're after the filthiest backhand slice, meme expertise, a reliable driver and one-drink wonder - look no further than Scott. This guy's the real deal."

    comment: "What do an OUBaC private chauffeur and treasurer have in common? Both spots will be filled by our resident medic Ian. Arriving at his bajilionth committee position Ian sure knows his way around a spreadsheet. Famed for his ability to say no (“LMAO get ****”), wise financial ideas (“we should invest in dogecoin”), and strategic mastermind (remember the 6-9 gambit) he will hopefully not ruin the club's successful financial run. Let’s just hope he is better at chasing people to pay than at chasing shuttles around the court."

    comment: "Back by popular demand is Allen Lee (3rd year DPhil), who last year broke the record for shortest M1 captain tenure after a season-ending ACL injury before the summer holidays! While we never got to see his managerial skills, his ability to still defend better than all of OUBaC while effectively only having one functional leg was still on display. Hopefully now he's back from surgery and raring to go and lift M1 to new heights.  "

    comment: "Having injured our promising freshers at last years trials, Mar had no choice but to apply for a masters so that she could captain W1 once more. Still searching for the elusive prEmotion, Mar promises to keep up morale by continuing the team’s two year streak of weekly BUCS recruitment memes. She is also committed to the cause of finding a permanent W1 taxi driver (if this sounds like you please send a copy of your CV to maria.umbertkimura@some.ox.ac.uk). <br /><br />

    Sharing the role with Mar, we have Sophie, who’s decided to play badminton for some more years (aka apply for a PhD) as she approaches Adult-1-hood. Sophie, with the highest BUCS availability and lowest injury tally in modern W1 times, will provide wisdom from her experience as covid-times captain. Memorable is her strong winning start against current English champion Kirby Ngan which set the score to 1-0 in Sophie’s favour. We are confident she will apply the same winning mentality to lead W1 out of Midlands 1.<br /><br />

    To prospective undergraduates: not to worry, Mar and Sophie will forever be undergrads at heart."

    comment: "Fresh off the back of terrorizing Cambridge both on the court and in the club, it was only natural that Zac would step up to the 2nd team captaincy this year. A dedicated player, attending almost every BUCs match, he single-handedly kept service station McDonald’s in business through his post game meals. However, if he ever attempts to throw his weight around, feel free to remind him that he lost to the 3rd team captain at trials."

    comment: "After pioneering the role of Welfare rep and as one of the clubs most active members, Siam has taken up the role which has been years in the making: M3 Captain. One of the Local League's finest, his commitment to long bus journeys and awkward match timings make him perfectly suited for all this post can throw at him. Singles players fear his drops, doubles players fear his flicks, and barbers fear if he decides to bring back the buzz cut."

    comment: "The Mdan, the Mdyth, the Mdlegend himself returns for yet another year! Fuelled by fried chicken, this powerhouse of recreational badminton organisation is back for more clubnight coordination. With his ever-expanding database of clubnight players and their skill levels, we have no doubt that everyone will have the best time playing varied and evenly-balanced matches. <br /><br />
    
    In addition, Rash is taking on the challenges of becoming the new L&C Secretary. Having represented for 4 different colleges in these tournaments (only one of them Jesus), there is no one more qualified to organise the matches and make sure teams turn up on time. Returning members of OUBaC will be comforted by his familiar presence; new joiners will soon discover that he practically lives at Iffley. Just be careful if you happen to face him on the singles’ court: you might just tear your ACL (but it’s ok he’s a medic)."

    comment: "As last year's winner of the coveted OUBaC ‘best entz attendance’ award, Charlotte (Regent's 2nd year) was a shoo in for this role. Whether it’s out of pure love for the club, or to compensate for being from a college with six other members, she will never miss a badminton social. Charlotte’s relevant experience includes saving welcome drinks (as a fresher) by running through Oxford in search of a speaker. <br /><br />

    Enyala (Queen’s 3rd year) took a year to join OUBaC once coming to Oxford, but hasn’t looked back since. A reliable figure at socials, and a vocal varsity supporter, she is not one to miss an event or a chance to sing. Providing some relative age and wisdom to the two younglings she completes a strong trio of entz reps. <br /><br />

    Scott (Univ 2nd year) has already made big waves in the squad after taking the helm of M2 captain and, more importantly, taking the m2ilf insta page to soaring new heights. Indeed, his commitment to wit and dank memage may only be rivalled by his commitment to having one drink at OUBaC socials before becoming near paralytically drunk, disappearing, and yet still managing a cameo appearance at parkend."

    comment: "She's been winning over hearts and bellies all year by providing seemingly endless snacks for the club, so what better Welfare Rep than My! We never knew so much welfare support could fit into such a small person, but as the Designated Responsible Adult in every situation, we can't think of anyone better to have a chat with when you're feeling down. My is sure to handle the mantle of Welfare Rep with her usual grace and dignity, and to support anyone (read: the men) with any badminton related welfare issues (read: bruised egos)!<br /><br />
    
    After an ungodly number of (failed) attempts to access the OUBaC bank account, we're not sure who needs Welfare more, Rob or the rest of the club combined. Undeterred, Rob steps into the Welfare shoes this year, ready to finally let people approach him, after having to chase everyone else all year to pay for subs, stash, dinner, drinks, more stash, more drinks...Rob is also one of the clubs toughest soldiers; he had to be banished from the court after spraining an ankle at Mixed Varsity, so is sure to be a fount of moral support and empathy for anyone who needs it, making him a perfect Welfare Rep."
