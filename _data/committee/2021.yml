   comment: "From the abundance of STEM students in OUBaC, Lucien, a 3rd year Physicist at St Peter’s has stepped up to add yet another committee role to his resume. Unfazed by pretty much everything (except the bouncers at Parkend who savagely removed him for innocently dancing his heart out) Lucien is sure to do an incredible job of running the club whilst using his free time to bash out his degree. Fuelled by an almost ungodly amount of sesame-seed bagels and bananas, and never afraid to tell you how it is, he’ll be taking the helm as we emerge from *shudder* Covid-19, so let’s hope his leadership skills are better than his dance moves."

   comment: "Coming off the back of a successful W1 Captaincy, in which she led her team to zero losses, Sophie has taken up the mantle of VP. As one of OUBaC’s best players, Sophie may help  run some of our sessions this year - a task well suited task to a third year engineer as she will have no problem creating an endless number of circuits. Having not lost to a single Loughborough player for over a year, Sophie has the confidence to take OUBaC to even greater badminton heights."

   comment: "As our treasurer for the second year in the row, Alex will have the all important job of making sure OUBaC's finances don't go into the red. He will need to use all his E&M skills to traverse the muddy waters of court hire costs, shuttles and Sportsfed grants. We have full confidence that he will excel in the role, as he sends OUBaC's revenues as high as his jump smash. (We're still a non-for-profit)"

   comment: "Pippa, a 4th Year DPhil, stars in yet another committee position for OUBaC. This year, she takes over from Matt as secretary for the club. Pippa has kept herself active during lockdown, participating in 10km runs and also joining the social tennis scene, but we look forward to her return to the badminton court. Her role as secretary will be especially pivotal this year, as the club aims to get going after COVID-19. Always a warm and bubbly personality, the club is in safe hands."

   name: James Lin
   email: james.lin@st-annes.ox.ac.uk
   comment: "Our incoming M1 captain, James, has made quite an impression in his first year at OUBaC. His many highlights include misdiagnosing his broken wrist after matriculation, and failing to make it past 7pm at the annual BBQ. His lack of a tolerance off-court contrasts his stamina on-court, where despite swapping training for beer two years ago, he is still capable of dishing out a run-around on the singles court. We have high hopes for James to become a leader within the squad, as he leads M1 to BUCS and Varsity success, and shows them how not to survive on a night out."

   comment: "When she's not showing off her periodic table paraphernalia at badminton practice, 2nd year chemistry student Hannah is probably cycling to badminton practice (yes she's at St Hughes). Our newest W1 captain's enthusiasm and dedication to the club could not be shaken even by the parking of a fellow member's car on her toes. It was at this point we knew she would be a *shoe* in for the role.
   tldr: Hannah will lead W1 to BUCS and varsity glory!!!"

   comment: "Luca is a 2nd year Law and German Law student who has made a promising start and shown great dedication to honing his skills, as well his badminton. When he is not doing shots out of J Lin’s belly button, he can be found on the courts with fierce determination, practicing till his feet bleed. He truly embodies the spirit of commitment to badminton and humble amiability we love to see here at OUBaC."

   comment: "Yuhang reprises his role as M3 captain this year. His dedication and keeness will inspire M3 to greater heights, with the return of the local league. Having trained hard in China during the first part of the pandemic, and now working daily at Iffley, he's striving towards his badminton goal: to beat Kento Momota in the Olympic Final at Paris 2024. A tough ask for sure, Kento will need to up his game!"

   name: Ian Ho
   email: ian.ho@wadham.ox.ac.uk
   comment: "Ian, a fourth year medic at Wadham, is surely going for the OUBaC record as the longest serving mixed captain, having now started his third year in the role. His affection for the job has taken its time to develop, and we hope this is the year he finally starts enjoying playing mixed doubles. With the return of the local league competition hopefully happening this year, Ian will have his hands full trying to convince us to play a mixed match away in Abingdon on a Tuesday night, especially when we could be at Plush instead. Ian will not be dazed by the challenge however, as he has honed his leadership and communication skills off-court, spending the past year dominating the online arenas of DOTA and League of Legends."

   comment: "After a few too many zoom quizzes and not a single chance to organise a clubbing night, it was inevitable Becky would run to retain her role for a second spell. Despite going into her third year she has only had two terms of normal badminton socials, so she will no doubt be keen to return to OUBaC's excellent social calendar. Andrew, however, is a veteran of the Oxford scene and his wisdom and experience will ensure that socials return to their legendary heights. It remains to be seen how long his belief that doing a PhD will give him plenty of time to do other things remains in tact."

   comment: "Andrew and Freya cannot get enough of being on OUBaC committees - they are the ultimate keen beans. Having both been on the committee for as long as current members can remember as part of what resembles a musical chairs of committee members over the years, their enthusiasm and experience as part of OUBaC will stand them in good stead taking over as our welfare reps this year. Freya, previous president, studies Classics and is often found explaining how relevant it is/making aesthetic revision timetables. Andrew, also previous president (see!), has just started a Chemistry PhD so it was nice knowing him before he's confined to labs forever. Freya and Andrew will work hard to signpost welfare resources offered by Sportsfed and the wider university to OUBaC members and are a port of call for members with any welfare question which can be discussed in complete confidence."

Always a smiling face at sessions, she has already successfully organised a cuppers event in Trinity 2021, with excellent participation levels. We hope that League & Cuppers competitions are similarly popular this year, and with Grisel's steely determination, we're sure that they will be."

Equipped with a fancy gaming laptop and aesthetic photos of swans on his Instagram feed, Andrew is the perfect man to be in charge of the club’s website and social media accounts. During Andrew’s time in charge we have already had the website temporarily suspended so he can only improve from here!"
