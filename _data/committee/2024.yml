    name: Ananya Kannan
    email: oubac.secretary@gmail.com
    comment: "Being W2 captain last season, Ananya has shown her capability to take on responsible roles in the club while staying on top of her academics. Her commitment towards the members and club was proven through undefeatable attendance at social events and local league matches (despite the long commute on dark roads and late nights). Ananya will surely be able to challenge the unpredictable local league schedule and questionable demands from other clubs."

    email: ayman.ahmad@univ.ox.ac.uk
    comment: "Armed with a new headband, Ayman is ready to lead M2 to a comeback Cobra Kai style. A dedicated cricket player, his backhand serves occasionally serves as a strong reminder of his passion for cricket – high and out of bounds. Jokes aside, Ayman likes to bring his Ay-game to the court when he needs to, much to the surprise and admiration of his fans. It is only natural that he becomes the Lisan Ay Gaib of M2.

            P.S You can find SpongeBob living in his hair when he uses a hair tie."

    comment: “After rising through the ranks of clubnight to go straight to W2, the only next natural step is for Cay to be the captain of W2!! His sporting talents range from athletics, swimming and of course badminton (hopefully his favourite!!). Although his smash is scary on coart, he is always smiley and cheery - hailing from Worcester college just like his predecessor, he is sure to take W2 to even greater Local League glory next season!!!”

    comment: "The Mdan, the Mdyth, the Mdlegend himself returns for yet another year! Fuelled by fried chicken, this powerhouse of recreational badminton organisation is back for more clubnight coordination. With his ever-expanding database of clubnight players and their skill levels, we have no doubt that everyone will have the best time playing varied and evenly-balanced matches. <br /><br />
    
    In addition, Rash is taking on the challenges of becoming the new L&C Secretary. Having represented for 4 different colleges in these tournaments (only one of them Jesus), there is no one more qualified to organise the matches and make sure teams turn up on time. Returning members of OUBaC will be comforted by his familiar presence; new joiners will soon discover that he practically lives at Iffley. Just be careful if you happen to face him on the singles’ court: you might just tear your ACL (but it’s ok he’s a medic)."

He has shown great sportsmanship and always has been a friendly face to every member of Clubnight. Fortunately, Hussain has volunteered to help us with day-to-day operations of OUBaC this year and we are happy to welcome him as our new Clubnight Rep!"

    comment: "As W2 captain, Ananya has shown her members constant support and care. By making sure the team has a fair amount of training and recognition, W2 went through the season with a great mentality and finished 2nd in the league. Ananya's ability to befriend everyone and put them at ease positioned her as a perfect Welfare Rep. The club members will undoubtedly be in good hands in the next season."
