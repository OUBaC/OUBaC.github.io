   name: Alistair Reed
   comment: "Sexy Maus/Angel Face/Justin, after a meteoric rise through the ranks has reached the pinnacle of OUBaC: Health &amp; Safety Rep. He will also be our President. Al will make use of his renowned organisational skills to delegate work as much as possible and though his 'badter' needs working on, he is guaranteed to put us in the 'zone' for a fantastic year of badminton. We beliebe."

 - role: Treasurer
   name: Alina Gerasimenko
   comment: Alina "the python" Gerasimenko is a second year lawyer from Univ. Her Russian heritage allows her to down huge quantities of wine with no ill effects (not true). She is looking forward to her duties this year and aims to be the most effective and intimidating treasurer the club has ever had.

 - role: Secretary
   name: Stephen Bedford
   comment: Stephen has been Men's 3rd team captain, treasurer and now secretary. Usually a quiet and thoughtful gentleman, on the court he is a tough competitor with a ferocious smash. Stephen is looking to use his experience to keep the new president in check.

   name: Mike Senior
   comment: Mike 'the grit' Senior is a post grad at Lincoln. Mike is an ex-rower and fitness freak (times have changed since Buffham was captain) and plans to work the squad into some kind of shape. When he is not in the gym Mike spends most of his time doing his hair or forcing the freshers to drink too much wine...

 - role: Men's 2nd team captain
   name: Clinton Lau
   comment: Back for another bite at this now auspicious apple, Chairman Lau returns to lead the 2nd team onwards on court (not just to the pub) and upwards (hopefully) in the league. In his spare time Clinton enjoys the company of his beloved guitar, in fact one could say he has a bit of a thing for playing with strings. Although, unlike past members of his team, not wearing ones that begin with a 'G'.

   comment: One half of the infamous 'pain' twins, Sarah has quickly familiarised herself with her fellow committee members. A second year earth scientist from Worcester, she hopes to take full advantage of the new entz budget (/rep) next year once she's drinking again.

   name: Nick Hale
   email:
   comment: Nick enjoys the finer things in life, wining and dining on the high table, but he's not afraid to get his hands dirty. Rumoured to run 10 miles a day and destroying marathons, our 3rds captain is a fitness machine who can outlast any opponent. And with a keen eye for photography, he knows what looks good and how to look good on court.

   name: Rachel Kenny
   email:
   comment: "Rachel 'still a perv' Kenny has become the Mixed Captain after running the team last year alongside her minor role with the Women's 1sts. The once reliable 21:00 Kenny train is considered to be well and truly de- railed after badminton socials have resulted in her \"years in Oxford : times ejected from clubs\" ratio at an impressive 1.0 . Next stop: the back door via the cheese floor."

   comment: With the deadliest flick serve in the game, the shuttle will be over your head before you can say 'Civaram Sivakumaran'. And with a 100% pulling record when he adorns those fishnets, he's a man's man when in women's clothing...watch out ladies, its's simply impossible to resist this guy's seductive charm.
