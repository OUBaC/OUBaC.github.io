    comment: "After leading M2 through a yet another successful BUCS season, Ayman has stepped up to be the next Lisan AY Gaib of OUBaC. Known for his love for Badminton and Cricket, Ayman is now constitutionally required to prioritise OUBaC over any other club, at least for a year. Donning his iconic headband, his work ethic on and off court combined with his CLUTCH Multi-Purpose Vehicle driving skills will surely steer OUBaC in the right direction."

    comment: "Hussain has joined Clubnight as a fresher and since then he has been a regular member who has gotten quite familiar with the inner workings of OUBaC. He has shown great sportsmanship and always has been a friendly face to every member of Clubnight. Fortunately, Hussain has volunteered to help us with day-to-day operations of OUBaC this year and we are happy to welcome him as the new Vice President and League & Cuppers Rep!"

    comment: "Hello Everybody! His name is Zishu Xu and he is the OUBAC treasurer for the forthcoming 25-26 calendar year. When asked to describe himself in three words... he would say: Committed, Big Smash, Singles Specialist (whoops that's five!). Nevertheless, I'm sure his passion on court, blended with his mathematical genius, will help him navigate the finances and battle against that pesky inflation!"

    comment: "After rising through the ranks of clubnight and having led the W2 charge last year, the only next natural step is for Cay to be the secretary of the club!! His sporting talents range from athletics, swimming and of course badminton (hopefully his favourite!!). Although his smash is scary on coart, he is always smiley and cheery - hailing from Worcester college just like his predecessor, he is sure to help manage the club to a brighter and better future!!!"

    comment: "Stepping up to lead M1 this year is the one and only BLeo!<br /><br />

              Strengths: Being our (not so) humble singles GOAT; torturing the M2 squad during training; rolling up his t-shirt sleeves for no reason.<br /><br />
              
              Weaknesses: Unable to bribe the IT rep to write a nice description."

    comment: "Freshly promoted from being the M3 captain, Jeremy now leads the charge against relegation for the M2 squad! His dedication to badminton can only be rivaled by his dedication to spend as much time on the floor as possible during his matches. We can only hope that this dedication (and his big brain) can come up with the strats necessary to achieve the impossible: getting M2 players to show up for away games!"

    comment: "Having mastered the art of studying maths by day and posting memes by night, Amy continues her position as the Social Media Rep. Not only this, but to achieve her dream to conquer the club, she has also taken the position of W1 captain (with this much free time, do maths students even work?).  Be it at the club, during training, or even suffering during S&C, Amy is always there to provide the good vibes that every club needs! "

    comment: "Lily is the pinnacle of commitment to badminton, missing two (or was it three?) of her friends‚Äô birthday parties just to play in the Local League.
              Her ankles might be weak, but her smashes definitely aren't. Still, she insists on playing front court, allowing her to ping opponents from point-blank range. Truly versatile ;)
              That said, there‚Äôs no denying her friendliness on court and if anyone can finally manifest the W2 hotpot social, it‚Äôs her <3"

He is a friendly and outgoing person, who can often be seen at one of the many famous OuBac food socials. We are sure that he will be able to propel M3 to even more local league success!"

    name: Crystal Huang
    emails: oubac.clubnight@gmail.com
    comment: "Famous for attending every single session (except when it interferes with brunch), Crystal has now decided she'd like to subject herself to responding to hundreds of emails, chasing rogue shuttles, and sitting through truly thrilling committee meetings.
              If she's not showing off a new tattoo, she's either making sure you know she's five foot SIX or complaining about her degree (she only does classics....).<br /><br />
              
              Despite these obvious red flags, we somehow decided she was the perfect person to take over clubnight.<br /><br />
              
              Crystal‚Äôs ready to make clubnight even more fun - and maybe even slightly more organized (no promises). Please be nice to her. Or at least bring her brunch."

              Always having a smile on her face and willingness to play some badminton, Linfei brings the good vibes both on and off court. Under her careful eye, clubnight is sure to be a great time for everybody involved!"

    comment: "Since OUBaC was founded in the 1950s, there are three pillars of the club that have withstood the test of time: good vibes, competitive spirit, and Sophie Taylor. Today, instead of joining her fellow alumni, she is somehow still at the club and has taken over the position of Alumni Rep! Always willing to bring the positive vibes and juicy gossip, we're sure that the Alumni rep position is in good hands!"

    comment: "Having been strong-armed into the position, Johnny now holds the highly coveted position of IT Rep (against his will). While we're not sure how good of an IT rep he'll be, there are 3 things we do know about him:<br /><br />
              1. He'll never show up to socials.<br /><br />
              2. He can always choke away games, no matter how much he leads by.<br /><br />
              3. Never let him play singles.<br /><br />"
