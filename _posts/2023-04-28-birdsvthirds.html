<p>
We kicked off the Trinity term with the Birds vs Thirds match (W1 vs M3). Having lost the previous encounter, the thirds were eager to strike back. After the annual team photo, the two teams went to separate establishments for their pre-game meals: the thirds headed to Rice Box, and the birds chose to consume KFC and edamame beans.

While the birds put up a strong fight, the thirds were able to claim a convincing 6-1 victory. We all went to the pub afterwards.
