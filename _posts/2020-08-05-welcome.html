<p>OUBaC would like to warmly welcome you all to Oxford and to our Club for the 2020/21 season! We know things will be a little different this year, but we’re looking forward to getting back on court as quickly and safely as possible. We aim to provide plenty of opportunities to get involved with the Club through the competitive <a href="/squad.html">Squad</a>, the <a href="/squad.html">Development Squad</a>, recreational <a href="/clubnight.html">Clubnight</a>, and through your college. For more details about college badminton, please <a href="/college-captains.html">email your captain</a> or ask one of our <a href="/the-committee.html">Committee members</a>. Although we can’t yet say exactly what shape this year will take for us, we’re sure that the Club will remain as strong as ever! We’ll provide, in whatever capacity we can, casual Clubnight badminton, as well as matches for the Squad against local teams, other universities, and the notorious <a href="/squad.html#Varsity">Varsity match against Cambridge</a>! When we’re not on court, OUBaC also organises regular social events for everyone, from nights out to mini-golf! We look forward to meeting you all in the new term!</p>

<p>Trials for the Squad will be held towards the start of term, the exact date is not yet confirmed but please check our social media for updates.</p>
