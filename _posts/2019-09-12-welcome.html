<p>O.U.Ba.C. would like to offer everyone a warm welcome to Oxford for the 2019/2020 season! There will once again be plenty of opportunities to play badminton this year including college badminton, Clubnight and in the Squad. Most colleges will be offering some recreational badminton within college and there will be opportunities to play against other colleges if you fancy a more competitive game. For more details about the badminton in your college,  email your captain (a list can be found <a href="/college-captains.html">here</a>) or ask one of the committee. O.U.Ba.C. also organises its own recreational badminton session, Clubnight. This is a chance for anyone based in Oxford to play some fun, light-hearted badminton and there is always a good game to be had! To find out more about the times that are running check out the sessions list <a href="/sessions.html">here</a>, find us at the Freshers' Fair or come along to one of the <b>free</b> sessions in 1st week. Those looking to play some competitive badminton might be interested in the Squad. This is an opportunity for some of the best players in the university to represent O.U.Ba.C. in matches against the local teams, other universities and in the all-important Varsity match. For a chance to join the squad see the information on trials below. </p>
