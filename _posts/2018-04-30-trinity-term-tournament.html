<p>
Blow off some revision-induced steam by signing up for the O.U.Ba.C. end of year tournament on Saturday 26th May, 15:30-17:30 (5th week). The format will be team based with players put into randomly drawn teams at the start of the event, so that each team has an equal chance of winning! Due to space constraints we are limited to approximately 24 clubnight players and 8 squad players, so don't delay in signing up below!
</p>
<p>
Guest players are welcome, but preference will be given to OUBaC members in the event of the tournament being oversubscribed. Everyone is welcome to attend the club social following the tournament :)

We hope to see you there!
