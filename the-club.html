	<h2>About the Club</h2>
	<img src="/assets/logo/logo-oxford-blue.svg" class="club-logo"/>
	<p><strong style="">Oxford University Badminton Club</strong> (O.U.Ba.C.) was  founded in the late 1920's and since then has been an integral part of  Oxford University sport, with over 60 years of Varsity history with Cambridge. O.U.Ba.C. is one of the largest university sports  clubs in Oxford, with over 150 regular members.  Almost all our matches  and practice sessions take place at the Oxford University Sports Centre  at Iffley Road.  Whilst catering for two different tastes, the club is  by no means divided:</p>
	<p>
	At <strong style="">Clubnight</strong>, players of any standard are  welcome. The atmosphere is very relaxed and friendly, and there will  always be like-minded players around to enjoy a match or two.
	</p>
	<p>
	The <strong style="">Squad</strong> offers the opportunity for more  experienced players to compete against other universities in the UK and prepare for the annual Varsity match against Cambridge. If you are interested in representing the University both in BUCS League matches and against Cambridge, come along to the university trials at the start of Michaelmas term.
	</p>
	<p>
	Aside from the athletic aspect of the club, a wide range of social  occasions arranged throughout the year give players an opportunity to  get to know each other both on and off the court.
