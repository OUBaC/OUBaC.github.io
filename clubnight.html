<h3>Michaelmas 2020 update:</h3>
<p>
	Due to COVID-19, there are no year/term membership options for the time being, instead we will be operating a pay-per-play system. We will also not be able to provide rackets so you will need to bring your own. For more information on how clubnight will be running, pricing and session sign-ups please join the club on Team App by clicking below.

<h2>Clubnight Tournament</h2>
<p>Alongside regular recreational sessions, all OUBaC members will have the opportunity to play in termly tournaments, with an emphasis on fun and socialising rather than competition. The tournaments will either run using a team format or be appropriately handicapped, to ensure that all entrants have a chance of securing a confectionary based prize.
