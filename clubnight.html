<h2>Clubnight Tournament</h2>
<p>Alongside regular recreational sessions, all OUBaC members will have the opportunity to play in termly tournaments, with an emphasis on fun and socialising rather than competition. The tournaments will either run using a team format or be appropriately handicapped, to ensure that all entrants have a chance of securing a confectionary based prize.
