<h2>Clubnight</h2>
<p>
	Clubnight is a time for all members of the Club to get together and play badminton. The friendly environment makes Clubnight lots of fun and a good place to make friends outside college. As the Club is so big there is always a good turnout which means plenty of competitive games for players of all standards. To ensure that everyone gets to meet everyone else and get an equal number of games a peg-board system is operated in most sessions. The club provides plastic shuttles (you can bring your own feather shuttles if you wish) and has a few racquets for members to use so you only need to bring along suitable shoes.
</p>
<p>
	Membership entitles you to well over 350 hours of badminton in the year with shuttles provided and a limited number of rackets available for those who do not have their own. (Guests are welcome at any Clubnight, but a &pound;{{site.data.variables.clubnight.single}} fee per session is charged for non-members.) There are also several heavily subsidised social events throughout the year, in particular, the Annual Black-tie Dinner which is a chance to get dressed up for an excellent night out. To find out how to join, see our booth at the Freshers' fair in Michaelmas term, or contact the clubnight representative.

<h2>Clubnight Tournament</h2>
<p>Alongside regular recreational sessions, all OUBaC members will have the opportunity to play in termly tournaments, with an emphasis on fun and socialising rather than competition. The tournaments will either run using a team format or be appropriately handicapped, to ensure that all entrants have a chance of securing a confectionary based prize.
</p>

<p>
The League and Cuppers competitions represent another opportunity for recreational players to get involved in some competitive Badminton. Running at Clubnight sessions throughout the year, college teams play off against each other to secure all-important bragging rights. Members of the University without a college are welcome to join the team of a participating college - for more information see the League & Cuppers section of our website or contact our L&C secretary.
